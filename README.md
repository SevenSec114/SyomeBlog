> I just dont wanna write this readme so generated by AI lol

View my blog at [Syome](https://syome.vercel.app)!!!

This is my personal static blog built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). Mainly for notes, rambling, experiments, and occasional rants.

## ✨ Stack

- Astro (obviously)
- TailwindCSS (for styling)
- Markdown content with frontmatter
- Vanilla JS for interactive bits
- Theme toggling via `localStorage`
- Search and caching via `sessionStorage`

## 🚧 Status

Still early days—currently working on:

- Navbar & Footer components
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Basic blog layout
- Markdown post templates
- projects on github
- Maybe some iframe-based playgrounds later 🤔

## 📦 Installation

To get this project up and running locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SevenSec114/SyomeBlog.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SyomeBlog/grubby-giant
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Additional Dependencies

For enhanced Markdown rendering, the following dependencies have been added:

- `@tailwindcss/typography` - For beautiful default styling of Markdown content
- `unified`, `remark-parse`, `remark-rehype`, `rehype-stringify`, `rehype-sanitize` - For custom Markdown processing

These are automatically installed when you run `npm install`, but if you need to install them separately:

```bash
# Install Tailwind CSS Typography plugin
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography

# Install remark/rehype ecosystem for custom Markdown processing
npm install unified remark-parse remark-rehype rehype-stringify rehype-sanitize
```

## 🌐 Deployment to GitHub Pages

To deploy your blog to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Update `astro.config.mjs` with your GitHub username and repository name:
   ```js
   export default defineConfig({
     site: 'https://your-username.github.io',
     base: '/your-repo-name',
     // ... other config
   });
   ```

2. Build your project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

Make sure to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with your repository name.

### Custom Domain Configuration

If you're using a custom domain like `blog.syome.com`, you'll need to:

1. Create a `CNAME` file in the `public` directory with your custom domain
2. Configure your DNS settings with a CNAME record pointing to `your-username.github.io`

For detailed instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

## 🎨 Features

### Markdown Rendering

The blog uses a custom Markdown rendering system with the following features:

1. **Tailwind CSS Typography Plugin** - Provides beautiful default styles for all Markdown elements
2. **Enhanced Markdown Renderer Component** - Custom Astro component with additional styling options
3. **Custom Processor** - Built with the remark/rehype ecosystem for maximum control

### Loading Animation

All pages include a loading animation that automatically hides when the page content is ready.

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Markdown Content

All blog posts and repos are written in Markdown and stored in `src/content/`. Each post should include frontmatter with:

- `title` - The post title
- `description` - A short description of the post
- `pubDate` - Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `tags` - Optional array of tags
- `language` - Reops' language usage for its post
- `repoUrl` - The github URL of the repo

### Styling

Styling is done with Tailwind CSS. Custom styles should be added to component files or global styles in `src/styles/`.

### Components

Reusable components are located in `src/components/`. Each component should be self-contained and well-documented.
